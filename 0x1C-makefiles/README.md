0x1C. C - Makefiles

Task 0
In Task 0, we create a basic Makefile that compiles two C source files into an executable named school.

Task 1
Task 1 extends Task 0 by introducing variables CC and SRC to the Makefile, allowing customization of the compiler and source files.

Task 2
Task 2 further enhances the Makefile by introducing variables OBJ and NAME, providing more flexibility in managing object files and the executable name.

Task 3
Task 3 adds additional rules to the Makefile for cleaning up temporary files, object files, and the executable. It also introduces the re rule for forcing recompilation of all source files.

Task 4
Task 4 expands on Task 3 by introducing the CFLAGS variable for specifying compiler flags, such as -Wall, -Werror, -Wextra, and -pedantic, ensuring strict code compliance.

Task 5
Task 5 is a technical interview preparation task involving writing a Python function island_perimeter to calculate the perimeter of an island represented in a grid.

Task 6
Task 6 is an advanced Makefile task that refines the Makefile from Task 4 by introducing more efficient cleanup rules and constraints on variable usage.
